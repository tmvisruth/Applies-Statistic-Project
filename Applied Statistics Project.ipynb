An electrical manufacturing company conducts quality checks at specified periods on the products it manufactures. Historically, the
failure rate for the manufactured item is 5%. Suppose a random sample of 10 manufactured items is selected. Answer the following
questions.

k=np.arange(0,11)
n=10
p=0.05
emc=stats.binom.pmf(k,n,p)
emc

Probability that none of the items are defective?

emc[0]

Probability that exactly one of the items is defective?

emc[1]

Probability that two or fewer of the items are defective?

stats.binom.cdf(2,n,p)

Probability that three or more of the items are defective ?

1-stats.binom.cdf(2,n,p)

A car salesman sells on an average 3 cars per week.

What is Probability that in a given week he will sell some cars?

rate = 3
n=np.arange(0,10)
cars = stats.poisson.pmf(n,rate)
1-cars[0]

What is Probability that in a given week he will sell 2 or more but less than 5 cars?

cars[2]+cars[3]+cars[4]

Plot the poisson distribution function for cumulative probability of cars sold per-week vs number of cars sold per week.

Accuracy in understanding orders for a speech based bot at a restaurant is important for the Company X which has designed,
marketed and launched the product for a contactless delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition accuracy that measures the
percentage of orders that are taken correctly is 86.8%. Suppose that you place an order with the bot and two friends of yours
independently place orders with the same bot. Answer the following questions.

n =3 
p=0.868
k=np.arange(0,11)
binom=stats.binom.pmf(k,n,p)

What is the probability that all three orders will be recognised correctly?

stats.binom.pmf(3, n, p)

What is the probability that none of the three orders will be recognised correctly?

binom[0]

What is the probability that at least two of the three orders will be recognised correctly?

1-stats.binom.cdf(1,n,p)

Applied statistics is a very important tool to predict the future and reduce the uncertainty. 
Consider an automoble parts manufacturing factory. Cpk (Process Capability Indice) use to measure the quality of the process. In Cpk measurement it takes a sample of more than 30 manufactured part and inspect every quality parameter. with the data collected during inspection will be analysed and estimate the population quality. Cpk helps to take decisions such as improvement in process, probability of rejection, so on.
T distribution, estimation technics are used in Cpk. 
Apart from Cpk manufacturing industry used other statistics and probability functions in planning, scheduling, and other various decision making. 

Company X manages the men's top professional basketball division of the American league system. The dataset contains information

times they came within the first 2 positions, how many tournaments they have qualified, their best position in the past, etc.
